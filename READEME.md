# Infinite Scroll with Modal Image Viewer

This project demonstrates an **infinite scroll** feature that loads images from an API (in this case, the Unsplash API) and displays them in a gallery. When an image is clicked, a **modal** is opened showing the image with the ability to close the modal.

## Features
- **Infinite Scroll**: The page loads more images as the user scrolls down.
- **Modal Viewer**: Clicking on any image opens it in a modal with the ability to close it.
- **Smooth UI**: The images inside the modal are well-positioned and scaled to maintain their aspect ratio.
- **Loading Spinner**: A spinner is displayed while images are being loaded.
